                <h4>Understanding Blockchain: Beyond Cryptocurrencies</h4>
                <p>
                    Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. 
                    While it's most famous for its role in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its applications go far beyond that. In supply chain management, 
                    blockchain ensures transparency and traceability of products from source to consumer. In healthcare, it provides secure sharing of patient data, 
                    enhancing privacy and efficiency. In finance, blockchain enables faster, more secure transactions with reduced costs. The potential for blockchain to disrupt 
                    industries is immense, as it improves security, reduces fraud, and creates new opportunities for innovation. As the technology matures, it's set to revolutionize various sectors.
